        <h1>Weightlifting</h1>
        <p>I think that everyone should excerise in some capacity, but specifially lifting weights.  It keeps your muscles, joints, and ligaments healthy.  Everyday life becomes noticeably easier as you get stronger and you feel better in general.  Combine lifting weights with a good diet and you will notice positive results within a month.</p>
        <p>For overall strength, I would reccomend doing the 4 major compound lifts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Benchpress</b></li>
            <li><b>Overhead Press</b></li>
            <li><b>Squat</b></li>
            <li><b>Deadlift</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is my weekly schedule as an example of how I workout:</p>
        <table border="1" style="border:black 2px solid" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="3" >
            <tr>
                <th>MON</th>

                <th>FRI</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Benchpress</th>

                <th>Rest Day</th>
                <th>Chest</th>
                <th>Back</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Triceps</th>
                <th>Hamstrings</th>
                <th>Rest Day</th>
                <th>Triceps</th>
                <th>Biceps</th>

        <p>For information on how to begin, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AlanThrall">Alan Thrall</a> on Youtube.</p>
        <p>I would also ecourage someone to do their own research and find excersises that they would like to try.  For me, that was where most of the fun and enjoyment came from when getting started!</p>
