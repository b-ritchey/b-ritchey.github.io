        <h1>My Motorcycle</h1>
        <p>One of my favorite outdoor activites is riding my motorcycle around Columbia.  There are many cool places to ride in the area and I have seen many differnt animals.  Animals like cows, goats, chickens, and strangly enough, a camel! </p>
        <p>My motorcycle is a <i>Genuine G400C.</i></p>
