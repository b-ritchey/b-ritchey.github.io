        <p>Learning about history is one of my favorite hobbies.</p>
        <p>Within history, I enjoy studying military history.</p>
        <p>Some of my favorite wars to study are both <i>World Wars</i>, <i>The Napoleonic Wars</i>, and <i>The Civil War</i></p>
        <p>Some of my favorite generals are Napoleon, U.S. Grant, and Hannibal of Carthage.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy learning about ancient and medieval history.  There is so much to to learn from the past to help us as people go forward that I encourage everyone to learn about history to some extent!</p>
        <p>One of my favorite youtube channels for history content is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VloggingThroughHistory">Vlogging Through History.</a> I highly recommend you check out his channel!</p>
